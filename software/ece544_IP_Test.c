*
* This file implements a test program for the PmodOLEDrgb, PmodENC and Nexys4IO
* custom peripherals. The peripherals provides access to the Nexys4 pushbuttons
* and slide switches, the LEDs, the RGB LEDs, and the Seven Segment display
* on the Digilent Nexys4 board and the PmodOLED and PmodENC connected to the PMOD
* expansion connectors on the Nexys4
*
* The test is basic but covers all of the API functions:
*	o initialize the Nexys4IO driver
*	o Set the LED's to different values
*	o Checks that the duty cycles can be set for both RGB LEDs
*	o Write character codes to the digits of the seven segment display banks
*	o Checks that all of the switches and pushbuttons can be read
*	o Performs a basic test on the rotary encoder and LCD drivers
* <pre>
* MODIFICATION HISTORY:
*
* Ver   Who  Date     Changes
* ----- ---- -------- -----------------------------------------------
* 1.00a	rhk	12/22/14	First release of test program.  Builds on the nx4io_test program.
* 2.00  sy	08/22/16	Modified the code and implemented the functionality of color wheel implementation
* 						and detection of the generated PWM for the RGB LED's
* </pre>
*
* @note
* The minimal hardware configuration for this test is a Microblaze-based system with at least 32KB of memory,
* an instance of Nexys4IO, an instance of the PMod544IOR2,  and an instance of the Xilinx
* UARTLite (used for xil_printf() console output)
